	<div id="instructions">Create a webpage containing a form that displays an input text box, radio buttons, checkboxes, and select items; along with a script that executes form validation.<br><br>

	Your script should validate whether the user has entered data in the input text box, has checked a radio button, has checked at least one checkbox, and has selected an option from the select items.<br><br>

	Use a submit button to invoke the validation script, so that the form is processed only when the form fields are valid. If a field is invalid then display a message to the user. In your form statement, use method="post" and an action that can be a mailto or a webpage(displaying that the form has been processed), but be sure to use input type="submit" for your submit button. Alternatively you can leave out the form's action and method, but then you should use an input type="button", along with displaying any appropriate messages. </div>
